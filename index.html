<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p>Over the years as I've mentioned design patterns, software architecture or functional programming people react as if I'm trying to get them to join a pyramid scheme. Truth be told it has felt like I'm giving a sale pitch to get people to part from their sanity. I began early in my career with books like the Gang of Four and Refactoring. I was immediately sold that this was the way to program even though I had neither the skill to follow the advice nor the experience to know if it was useful. I have certainly struggled to find fellow programmers willing to follow the advice given in these books. Over the years, as I've gained both experience and skill, I have started to see how to pragmatically apply some of these principles and not just trust in some utopia vision. In fact, it seems that lately given specific circumstances things are starting to click. So, here I am writing a blog to share the experience of furthering my understanding and the fruits of implementation. I don't expect anyone to read this, but it sure helps me.</p>
